## How to use this shit ui ??
Download the current "stable" version from the [releases tab](https://github.com/Mathicha/tera-proxy-gui/releases).
Start it with 'run.bat' (as admin).

(Or check [not-master](https://github.com/Mathicha/tera-proxy-gui/tree/not-master) branch)

If this doesn't work open an [issues](https://github.com/Mathicha/tera-proxy-gui/issues/new), or message me on discord Mathi#6969
